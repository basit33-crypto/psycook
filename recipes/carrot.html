    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>Carrots lead a crunchy rebellion with radioactive herbs and zesty blasts. One bite? You're either dead or delicious.</p>
    <h4>Ingredient</h4>
   <h5>For the onions:</h5> 
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>2 large yellow onions, thinly sliced lengthwise</li>
            <li>Salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sherry vinegar</li>
        </ul>
    <h5> For the white sauce:</h5> 
        <ul>   
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>2 1/2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 1/2 cups milk</li>
            <li>1 pinch ground nutmeg</li>
            <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon ground thyme</li>
        </ul>
    <h5>For the topping:</h5>
        <ul>   
            <li>2 tablespoons melted butter</li>
            <li>⅔ cup panko bread crumbs</li>
            <li>2 pounds fresh green beans, trimmed</li>
            <li>4 ounces shredded Gruyere cheese, divided</li>
            <li>⅓ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        </ul>
    <h4>Step</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch casserole dish.</li>
            <li>Heat 2 tablespoons of butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir onions into the pan; cook and stir until very soft and golden brown, about 15 minutes. Stir in sherry vinegar. Transfer to a small bowl, and reserve.</li>
            <li>In the same skillet, melt 2 more tablespoons butter. Whisk in 2 tablespoons flour. Stirring constantly, cook over medium heat until flour smells like baked pie crust, about 3 minutes. Slowly whisk in milk, about 1/2 cup at a time, then whisk in nutmeg, cayenne pepper, and thyme. Bring to a simmer, and cook until thickened, whisking constantly, 3 more minutes. Transfer to a bowl and reserve.</li>
            <li>Melt remaining 2 tablespoons butter in clean skillet; stir in panko until all crumbs are coated; reserve.</li>
            <li>Bring a large saucepan of salted water to a boil over medium heat, and boil beans until bright green and crisp but not raw tasting, 3 to 4 minutes. Drain very well.</li>
            <li>Spoon half of the caramelized onions into the prepared casserole dish; top with green beans. Season with salt and black pepper. Spread reserved white sauce over the green beans; sprinkle with half of the Gruyere cheese. Top with the rest of the onions, and use the back of a spoon to push onions down into sauce and cheese. Top with the buttered panko crumbs, the remaining Gruyere, and Parmesan cheese.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until hot throughout and lightly browned, about 30 minutes. Let sit 10 minutes before serving.</li>
        </ol>
